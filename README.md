This repository is all about our final year project on an utility software specifically a mobile application for finding recipes and other features.
The Recipe Finder App brings together all essential features needed for an efficient and enjoyable cooking experience. One of its key highlights is the integration of an interactive chatbot that assists users with cooking-related queries, ingredient substitutions, and personalized recipe suggestions based on user preferences. In addition to this, the app leverages AI technology to generate entirely new recipes by analyzing patterns, ingredients, and methods from existing recipes stored in the system. This AI-driven feature helps users discover unique and creative meal ideas, enhancing their culinary experience. By combining intelligent assistance with innovation, the app simplifies cooking and encourages experimentation in the kitchen.
